1. 
We have implemented a model based agent, within the state we update the current grid and the number of keys. 
The grid is updated when keys are collected, doors are opened and current location is changed.

2. 
    a.  fully obersvable 
        needs to be fully obersvable to calculate the heusristic based on the goal state

    b.  single agent
        there is only one pathfinder in the grid

    c.  deterministic 
        Only agents actions affect the state, the next state is determined by the current state + pathfinder action

    d.  sequential 
        The current action of the pathfinder affects the future states

    e.  static
        The environment is not changing while the agent is deciding the next action

    f.  discrete
        there are only a max of 4 action in a state, there is no time constraint, 

    g.  known
        the agent knows how to move (traverse an edge)

3.  
We used Manhatten distance for our A* search
h = abs(current_x - goal_x) + abs(current_y - goal_y)

To show our heurisitic is consistent:

i. h(n) <= cost(n,n') + h(n')

    Consistency Proof:
    Consider a node n and successor n' 
    h(n) = abs(n_x - goal_x) + abs(n_y - goal_y)
    h(n') = abs(n'_x - goal_x) + abs(n'_y - goal_y)
    h(n) - h(n') = (abs(n_x - goal_x) + abs(n_y - goal_y)) - (abs(n'_x - goal_x) + abs(n'_y - goal_y))
                <= abs(n_x - n'_x) + abs(n_y - n'_y) 
                <= distance(n, n')
                <= cost(n,n')
            h(n) <= cost(n,n') + h(n')

    aside
        abs(n_x - goal_x) - abs(n_x' - goal_x) = abs(n_x - n'_x)
        this shows that when calcuating the vector in the x direction, the difference between n'_x to goal and n_x to the goal is the same as n to n'
        this case also applies to the y vector 

ii. h(goal) = 0

    h(goal) = abs(goal_x - goal_x) + abs(goal_y - goal_y) = 0

6. 
Since we are using Manhatten distance as our heuristic, keys and doors are not considered, 
we only store the distance from the current state to the goal state.
The Q3 Consistent heurisitic proof is still valid as the new modification has no effect on the formula
h(n) <= cost(n,n') + h(n') or h(goal) = 0
